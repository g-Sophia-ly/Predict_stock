# Predict_stock

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Background
This project is part of the **Kaggle Playground Series S5E1** competition, where the goal is to predict **sales volume (`num_sold`)** for different **countries, store types, and product categories**. The dataset provides **historical sales data from 2010 to 2019**, and we aim to use **time series analysis** and **machine learning models** to make accurate predictions.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration & Analysis
### Dataset Overview
- **Total Records**: **230,130 entries**, with 6 features (`id`, `date`, `country`, `store`, `product`, `num_sold`).
- **Target Variable (`num_sold`) Summary**:
  - **Average sales**: 752.53
  - **Median sales**: 605
  - **Range**: **Min 5**, **Max 5939**
  - **Missing values**: **8,871 missing values** in `num_sold`

### Time Series Analysis
To determine whether the data is stationary, we conducted the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test**:
- **ADF Test Statistic**: -32.51
- **p-value**: 0.0
- **Conclusion**:
  - Since **p-value < 0.05**, we **reject the null hypothesis**, meaning the data is **stationary**.
  - This makes it suitable for **time series forecasting models** like **ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet**.

### Sales Trends & Insights
1. **Overall Sales Trend**:
   - **Strong seasonal patterns** where sales **peak every December** due to holiday promotions.
   - **Sales increased from 2017 to 2019**, but the growth rate slowed down.

2. **Sales by Country**:
   - **Highest sales**: **USA**, followed by **Canada** and **Japan**.
   - **Lowest sales**: üá´üáÆ **Finland**.

3. **Sales by Store Type**:
   - **Discount Stickers stores** had the highest sales, followed by **Regular Stickers stores**.
   - **Online Stores** had lower sales but showed **growth from 2018-2019**.

4. **Sales by Product**:
   - **Top-selling product**: **Kaggle Stickers**
   - **Lowest-selling product**: **Holographic Goose Stickers**
   - **Kaggle Tiers & Kerneler Dark Mode Stickers** had **stable sales** with **less seasonal variation**.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering üõ†Ô∏è
To enhance our model's predictive performance, we engineered several key features:

1. **Time-based Features**
   - Extracted **year (`year`), month (`month`), weekday (`weekday`)**.
   - Created a **holiday indicator (`is_holiday`)** to capture seasonal effects.

2. **Sales Smoothing Techniques**
   - **Rolling Mean (Moving Average)** to reduce noise.
   - **Sales Growth Rate** to track market trends.

3. **Categorical Feature Encoding**
   - One-Hot Encoding applied to `country`, `store`, and `product` to improve model learning.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Model - LightGBM
We trained and evaluated **LightGBM (LGBMRegressor)** for sales forecasting using **5-Fold Cross Validation**:

- **Hyperparameters Used**:
  - `num_leaves`: 426, `max_depth`: 20, `learning_rate`: 0.011
  - `n_estimators`: 1000, `metric`: 'rmse', `early_stopping_rounds`: 200
  - Regularization parameters (`reg_alpha`, `reg_lambda`) were optimized.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Measures overall model accuracy.
  - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Evaluates relative percentage errors.

- **Results**:
  - **Fold 1 MAPE**: 0.0148
  - **Fold 2 MAPE**: 0.0150
  - **Fold 3 MAPE**: 0.0154
  - **Fold 4 MAPE**: 0.0156
  - **Fold 5 MAPE**: 0.0151
  - **Overall MAPE (LightGBM)**: **0.0152**
  - **LightGBM performed well**, capturing seasonality patterns but with slight underestimation during holiday peaks.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Prediction Results
Final **LightGBM model predictions** vs. **actual sales**:
- **Overall error is low**, but holiday sales fluctuations could be improved.
- **Seasonal patterns were well captured**, though some months (e.g., Black Friday sales) had deviations.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusions & Future Improvements
### Key Takeaways
- **Sales are highly seasonal**, especially during holidays.
- **LightGBM performed well**, but incorporating time-series models could improve long-term trends.
- **Sales patterns differ across countries & stores**, requiring tailored forecasting strategies.

### Future Enhancements
1. **Advanced Time Series Models**: Try **LSTM or Prophet** for improved long-term forecasting.
2. **Holiday Effects Optimization**: Assign higher weights to holiday seasons.
3. **AutoML for Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize models automatically to enhance accuracy.
